# Code Generation and Compilation

The design of systems with reactor-uc and Lingua Franca (LF) follows a top-down approach, where the programmer starts with a design written in the LF language. The LF compiler (lfc) translates this design into C code that uses the reactor-uc runtime library for execution. This generated code is platform-agnostic and can be compiled for various embedded and resource-constrained systems.

## Code Generation Process

The LF compiler (lfc) is the code-generator that transforms LF source files into C code. lfc analyzes the reactor model, performs optimizations, and generates:

- Reactor definitions and connections
- Event scheduling logic
- Platform-specific initialization code
- Network communication code for federated systems

For federated (distributed) programs, lfc generates separate subfolders for each federate, containing the necessary code and build files for that node.

## reactor-uc Runtime Library

reactor-uc is technically a runtime library written in C, providing the core execution engine for the reactor model. It implements:

- Event-driven scheduling
- Logical time management
- Network communication protocols
- Platform abstraction layers

The library is highly configurable through compile-time flags, allowing it to be tailored for specific platforms and use cases without runtime overhead. Common configuration options include:

- **Logging levels**: Control verbosity for debugging and monitoring
- **Platform features**: Enable/disable platform-specific optimizations
- **Network protocols**: Select supported communication interfaces
- **Memory management**: Configure buffer sizes and allocation strategies

## Build System Integration

reactor-uc enables seamless integration into existing toolchains. The generated code includes importable build files (CMake or Makefiles) that can be incorporated into your project's build system.

### Zephyr Integration

For Zephyr-based projects, lfc provides integration through a custom west command. The build process follows the standard Zephyr workflow:

1. west calls lfc to generate C code from LF sources
2. Generated code is compiled alongside reactor-uc library
3. west uses CMake to configure and build the final executable

### RIOT OS Integration

For RIOT OS projects with Make-based toolchains, lfc is integrated into the application Makefile:

1. `make all` first invokes lfc on LF sources
2. Generated sources are compiled with the reactor-uc library
3. Standard RIOT build process produces the binary

### Other Platforms

For common platforms like Raspberry Pi Pico (pico-sdk), we provide build templates that simplify integration. The generated CMake files can be imported directly into your project's build configuration.

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[LF Source Files] --> B[lfc Code Generator];
  B -->|Generates C Code| C[Platform-Specific Code];
  D[reactor-uc Library] --> E[Configured with Compile Flags];
  C --> F[Build System];
  E --> F;
  F --> G[Cross Compiler];
  G --> H[Binary];
```

This approach ensures that reactor-uc applications can be built using familiar tools while benefiting from the deterministic execution guarantees of the reactor model.
