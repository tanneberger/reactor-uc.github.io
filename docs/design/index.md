# Design Philosophy

reactor-uc brings the **reactor model of computation** to resource-constrained embedded systems. This section explains the core concepts, design decisions, and trade-offs that shape the runtime.

## Why reactor-uc?

Concurrent programming on embedded systems is notoriously difficult. Traditional approaches—bare-metal interrupts, RTOS tasks, or event loops—require developers to manually manage synchronization, timing, and communication. This leads to:

- **Race conditions** from unprotected shared state
- **Deadlocks** from improper lock ordering
- **Non-determinism** that makes debugging nearly impossible
- **Timing bugs** that only manifest under specific conditions

The reactor model offers a fundamentally different approach: **deterministic concurrency through logical time**. Instead of reasoning about physical time and thread interleavings, developers define reactive components that respond to events at well-defined logical instants.

## The Reactor Model

At its core, the reactor model structures programs as a composition of **reactors**—isolated components that communicate through well-defined **ports** and **connections**. Each reactor contains:

- **State** that is private and encapsulated
- **Reactions** that execute atomically in response to triggers
- **Ports** for typed communication with other reactors
- **Timers and Actions** for scheduling future events

This model is implemented in the [Lingua Franca](https://lf-lang.org) coordination language, and reactor-uc serves as the execution runtime for embedded targets.

## Design Principles

### 1. Determinism Through Logical Time

Every event in reactor-uc occurs at a **logical time**, independent of when it physically executes. Events at the same logical time are ordered by **microsteps**, providing a total ordering of all events. This means:

- Given the same inputs, the program produces the same outputs
- Debugging is reproducible—you can replay executions exactly
- Testing is meaningful—no flaky tests from timing variations

### 2. Resource Efficiency

Embedded systems have tight memory and CPU constraints. reactor-uc is designed with this in mind:

- **No dynamic allocation at runtime**—all memory is pre-allocated
- **Minimal dependencies**—just the C standard library (and nanopb for federation)
- **Compile-time configuration**—unused features have zero overhead

### 3. Composability

Complex systems are built from simpler parts. reactor-uc supports:

- **Hierarchical reactors**—reactors can contain child reactors
- **Typed connections**—ports enforce type compatibility
- **Modular design**—reactors are reusable building blocks

### 4. Platform Independence

The same reactor program can run on different targets:

- POSIX (Linux, macOS) for development and testing
- Zephyr RTOS for production embedded deployments
- RIOT OS for IoT devices
- Raspberry Pi Pico for hobbyist and educational use
- FreeRTOS for existing RTOS-based projects
- Bare metal for maximum control

A thin **platform abstraction layer** provides timing, synchronization, and I/O primitives for each target.

### 5. Distribution Without Sacrificing Correctness

reactor-uc supports **federated execution**—distributing reactors across multiple nodes connected by networks. The runtime maintains determinism guarantees through:

- **Safe-To-Process (STP)** constraints that bound waiting time
- **Clock synchronization** to align physical clocks
- **Startup coordination** to ensure all nodes begin together
